## Introduction

A couple of years ago I was gifted some [Ilford Delta 3200 ISO black and white film](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/delta-3200-professional-35mm) by my parents, a highly sensitive film that is designed for use in low-light conditions such as indoors without the flash on and at night-time. Ideally you'd have a good camera which could easily calibrate itself for the high sensitivity, however the only 35mm camera I have to hand is a Kodak Ektar H35n -- a half-frame, fixed shutter speed camera. At least it has a glass lens.

The main difficulty created by this combination of camera and film is surprisingly not the lack of control over the shutter speed, but rather the interaction between the large film grain size which is being accentuated by the camera halving the frame size. As a result, you need to keep in mind at all times that there will be very little fine detail in the final photos. High contrast scenes are imperative to avoid it turning out like a murky mess.

The photos I will show here were taken in three places. The first location was in Cambridge, after a rare snowfall had coated the town in a lovely blanket of white, creating that visual crucial contrast between the dark buildings and the bright snowy ground. 

The other two locations were a bit of a crapshoot, taken during a bouldering/walking trip in Yorkshire. On the first day we took a bouldering mat to the strikingly carved landscape of Brimham rocks. The area is rather dark overall, as the rocks are dotted in amongst trees and mossy knolls. This forced me to prioritise shots of rocks against the sky or using the brightness of our clothing against the dark rock.

On the second day we ventured up to Ilkley Moor (baht 'at) which was wet and shrouded in a thick cloudy mist. The only hope I had of getting good photos up here was taking close-by photos of people to silhouette them against the pure white sky. Ultimately I knew the photos were going to be extremely low quality but that's exactly what I was aiming for. Unhappily wet figures traipsing through the chewed-up mud while blanketed in a thick fog led to photos which mirrored those of old 1920s expeditions.

# Conclusions

I was scared when waiting for these photos to develop that I'd made a terrible mistake and that there would be nothing recognisable in the final images but I am so glad that the photos came out so atmospheric. 

As a photographer I am heavily inspired by the album covers of Godspeed You! Black Emperor:

I am happy that I've achieved this low fidelity while documented a very cool trip up to Yorkshire! Think I might go back to nice easy Kodak Gold 200 for a bit though.
