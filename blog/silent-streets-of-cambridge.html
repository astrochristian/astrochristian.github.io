Out in West Cambridge, far from the bustle of undergraduates pouring out of Vinyl to leave their various marks on the streets, far from the crowd of tourists huddling around the Corpus Clock waiting for the grasshopper to crawl to the next hour, and far from the blur of bicycles, e-scooters and pedestrians hurtling along Sydney Street lies the residential areas of Eddington and Darwin Green. These are both new build developments, Eddington opening in 2017 and Darwin Green in 2022 with the two lying either side of Huntingdon Road. Eddington was developed by the University of Cambridge to provide accommodation for its academic staff, while Darwin Green was designed more generally for the growing Cambridge population.</p><p>The specifics of the developments aren't important here. Rather, I want to discuss the experience of walking around these areas in 2026, most notably the pristene silence of the streets. It's rare that in a city you'd get this kind of quiet and it's exactly why I love these areas so much.</p><p>I'll start with Eddington, as it's by far the most developed of the two areas. Eddington has a simulacrum of a town square and - to give it its due - it's close to achieving the community that it so desperately is trying to build. On one side of the town square is a Sainsbury's which lights up the area with the big windows and a bright orange sign. On the other side is a pizzeria, a bike shop, an organic food shop and a rather nice cafe. Behind the square are hotels: the Hyatt and Turing Locke, which have an associated restaurant called the 'Star Man'. This is the core of Eddington and the square is where any events happen - once a week there's a food van and every so often they hold big events such as a beer garden. </p><p>Once you walk away from Eddington square, however, you're deep in suburban Eddington. Out here it's just yourself and the identical, perfectly clean townhouses. I like to relate this part of Eddington to the Squidville episode of Spongebob.</p><p><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/a/ae/Squidville_061.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20230209220613" alt="Tentacle Acres, aka Eddington" /></p><p>Darwin Green on the other hand is much newer and so has not had the same amount of time as Eddington to attempt to grow its community. While it's clear that people are living in the myriad apartments in this area, the centre of Darwin Green is populated with empty retail lots and dirty, litter-filled fields with big signs saying things such as 'Future Supermarket' and 'Future Primary School'. It's odd to see these unfulfilled promises to the Darwin Green residents so blatantly, but some of it may be down to the troubles the development has had after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cv2548v1dpyo">the developers had to demolish 88 of their brand new homes</a>.</p><p>The thing that really unites these two areas is their quietness. Now I do have to caveat this to say that these places are only truly quiet at night. Both areas are under active development so during weekdays, in the light, Eddington and Darwin Green are filled with a cacophony of drills, rumbling heavy trucks and hammer strikes from the construction sites which encircle both developments. But out-of-hours, the two areas are quiet as mice.</p><p>I grew up in the rural countryside of North Wales so I often find myself missing the quietness of the mountain air. Cambridge has no shortage of green spaces, but it also has no shortage of people who like to use those green spaces. However, out in West Cambridge I am able to find that solitude I so crave. It's odd really. Suburbia should be the antithesis of my countryside ideal, but the surgically sculpted park of Darwin Green manages to emulate the peace and darkness of my childhood.</p><p>It's also quite an anonymous area. Cambridge is so dominated by the university that, if you're part of it, it's quite hard to walk through Central Cambridge without running into someone you know. West Cambridge never seems to have that issue, partly because it's very sparsely populated, but also maybe because I'm still embedded in the collegiate system which is more centrally weighted. </p><p>Either way, for someone like me who is unfortunately quite bad at doing any kind of physical exercise, the anonymity of West Cambridge really helps when I want to try (and fail) to start running or do a long, but monotonous cycle. Try as I might, I can't stop my brain from feeling embarrassed when a stranger sees me using my muscles once a month - probably why I am so drawn to the solitude of mountain sports. While not as entirely desolate as the lesser walked paths of Eryri, these areas once again bring me back to my homeland.</p><p>I think what really ties the two areas together is the idea of liminality. I am a big fan of the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/">r/LiminalSpace</a>, which is a community of people who share photos of places which feel like they are in an active state of transition. Dying shopping malls with just a few lingering shops, or the unnerving small town feel of David Lynch's Twin Peaks are good examples of liminality. Walking around Eddington and Darwin Green, I feel exactly the same feeling. These areas are sitting in the doctor's waiting room, not knowing if it the diagnosis is going to be good or bad.</p><p>I have no grand conclusion to my thoughts on these areas. This is just meant to be a few musings that came to me on my last wander through West Cambridge. All I can say is that I think you should visit them after dark while they're still desolate. It's worth going alone - I think it's a safe enough area that despite the smothering darkness of Darwin Green's park it should be fine. Your walk should be analogous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3">John Cage's 4'33"</a> - the music isn't there (because there is none), the music is the environment around you. The constant but soothing white noise of the M11 roaring past Eddington, the soft ripple of the pond in Darwin Green, the soft clatter of an poorly oiled bike passing on the impossibly dark bike path. This is the beautiful silence of the streets of Cambridge's new builds.
